# Detekt Guide

This document says what **detekt** checks in the project, where it runs, the project's own rules, how a finding is dealt with, and how an app that uses Pantrix UI turns these rules on.

## 1. What Is Detekt?

Detekt is a static code analysis tool for Kotlin. Kotlinter looks at how code looks; detekt looks at what code does and how it is built: a function that is too complex, code that is not needed, a place where a rule is broken. Two kinds of rules run in this project:

*   **detekt's own rules:** complexity, naming, likely bugs, style.
*   **The project's own rule set, `PantrixUIRule`:** in the module `tooling/detekt-rules`. The machine's form of the library's rules in CONTRIBUTING.md, and of the rules of accessibility, language and tokens.

## 2. Where Does It Run?

| Where | Configuration | What runs |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| The library's modules (`ui/foundation`, `ui/components`, `ui/annotations`, `ui/testing`, `ui/material3`) | `config/detekt/detekt.yml` in this repository | detekt's rules and the project's rules for the library. Every finding stops the build. |
| The demo (`app/*`) | `config/detekt/demo.yml` in this repository, printed in section 5 | Only the four rules of the project that an app keeps too: `NoMaterialImport`, `FixedSideLayout`, `ImageWithoutDescription`, `UntaggedControl`. The last two report but do not stop the build. |

Of detekt's own rules, `UndocumentedPublicClass`, `UndocumentedPublicFunction` and `UndocumentedPublicProperty` are on in the library: no class, function or property is left without KDoc. An enum's entry counts as a property too. Parameters are held by the project's `UndocumentedParameter` (section 3).

The setup is in this repository's own build logic, for the library and for the demo; what an app writes for the same is in section 5. Tests are outside the project's rules.

Running it:

*   **`./gradlew detekt`:** in every module, runs each target's own task. In Kotlin Multiplatform the analysis is made target by target (`detektMetadataCommonMain`, `detektJvmMain`, `detektAndroidMain`, `detektIosArm64Main`…); the plain `detekt` task is wired to all of them, or it would pass green without looking at anything.
*   **`./gradlew :ui:components:detekt`:** in a single module.
*   **After the rules change** (`tooling/detekt-rules`): `./gradlew detekt --no-daemon`. A daemon that is running keeps using the old rule classes. `./gradlew --stop` is not used: it stops the IDE's daemon too.

The reports are in each module's `build/reports/detekt/` folder: HTML (for reading) and SARIF (for tools).

## 3. The Project's Rules

| Rule | What it holds | Where it is on |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `NoMaterialImport` | There is no Material in the library: no import of Material, and no name of Material written in full | The library (but the bridge to Material 3, `ui/material3`), the demo |
| `NoFoundationPrimitive` | Text goes through Pantrix's wrappers: `BasicText`, `BasicTextField` and `BasicSecureTextField` only in the wrappers' own files | The library |
| `UnmarkedComponent` | Every public `Pantrix…` composable is either a component (`@PantrixComponent` and two `@PantrixExample`s) or a part of a component (`@PantrixComponentPart`) | `ui/components` |
| `SettingInStrings` | `PantrixStrings` carries words only: a setting is a parameter of the component or of the locale | The library |
| `TagFromVisibleText` | An automation tag and its key are not built from visible text | The library |
| `RawTestTag` | A component puts its tag on with `Modifier.pantrixTestTag`, which keeps to the tag policy and the test scope, not with `Modifier.testTag` | The library |
| `EmptyComposableDefault` | A composable lambda's default is `null`, not an empty lambda; an empty lambda adds a public `ComposableSingletons` class to the ABI | The library |
| `KDocNotASentence` | A KDoc's summary is a sentence: it starts with a capital and ends with a full stop (names written in lower case, such as `iOS`, may come first) | The library |
| `UndocumentedParameter` | Every parameter of a public function or constructor is described: by a link `[name]` in the KDoc's text, by a `@param` or `@property` tag, or by the parameter's own KDoc. A declaration with no KDoc at all is left to detekt's `UndocumentedPublicFunction` and `UndocumentedPublicClass`. An override's description (a constructor's `override val` too) is in what it overrides, and an `actual`'s in its `expect` | The library |
| `TagKeyLast` | A component's `tagKey` is its last parameter: what it gains goes right before the key, and only the content lambda it draws, one that is composable or is called on a scope, comes after it. A component is a composable function or a public class's constructor; a function that works on a key, such as `pantrixTestTagOf`, and an override are left out | The library |
| `LiteralTextInLibrary` | What a component says comes from `PantrixStrings`; no fixed text goes to the screen or to a screen reader. Names given to tools, such as an animation's label and an inspector's name, do not count | The library (but its packs of words) |
| `FixedSideLayout` | Layout follows the reading direction: start and end in place of `absolutePadding`, `absoluteOffset`, `AbsoluteAlignment`, `Arrangement.Absolute` | The library, the demo |
| `SizeOutsideStyle` | A component's size is in its style or in a named constant; no `12.dp` is written in the code. 0 and 1 are free | `ui/components` (but the style files) |
| `ColorOutsideTokens` | A component's colour comes from the theme or from its own colours; no `Color(0xFF…)` is written | `ui/components` (but the style files) |
| `ImageWithoutDescription` | An image says what it shows, or says it is decoration with `contentDescription = null`; an empty description is not given | The demo (reports) |
| `UntaggedControl` | A control carries a `tagKey` (or is bound to a form's field, or puts its tag on in its `modifier` itself). A chip given `onClick = null` that shows only a word, and a list's row given no `onClick` at all, which is only read, do not count as controls | The demo (reports) |

Where the rules can be configured (`allowedPathPattern`, `includes`, `excludes`, lists of names) is written in each rule's KDoc.

## 4. Dealing With a Finding

A finding is closed in one of two ways:

*   **It is fixed.** This is the answer to most findings.
*   **It is suppressed where it stands, with its reason.** Where a rule is broken on purpose, the suppression goes in the narrowest place (a constant, a small function) and its reason is written on the same line:

```kotlin
@Suppress("FixedSideLayout") // A JSON document is laid out from the left in every language.
private val COPY_CORNER: Alignment = AbsoluteAlignment.TopRight
```

**No baseline is used.** A baseline file puts the finding where nobody looks; while the finding is there, the rule seems to be kept.

## 5. Pantrix's Rules in Your Own App

The rules are published as `com.pantrixui:detekt-rules`. An app gives them to detekt as a plugin, with detekt 1.23 (the rules are compiled against detekt 1.23.8's API) and wired to every target of a Kotlin Multiplatform module, as Pantrix's own build does:

```kotlin
// The shared module's build.gradle.kts.
plugins {
    // The rules are written against detekt 1's API (io.gitlab.arturbosch.detekt.api): detekt 2 does not load them.
    id("io.gitlab.arturbosch.detekt") version "1.23.8"
}

detekt {
    buildUponDefaultConfig = true
    config.setFrom(rootProject.file("config/detekt/detekt.yml"))
    basePath = rootProject.projectDir.absolutePath
}

dependencies {
    detektPlugins("com.pantrixui:detekt-rules:0.2.1")
}

tasks.withType<io.gitlab.arturbosch.detekt.Detekt>().configureEach {
    // Generated sources, such as Compose's resource accessors, are not the app's to check.
    exclude { it.file.absolutePath.contains("${File.separator}build${File.separator}") }
}

// In Kotlin Multiplatform the plain task looks at an empty source set: it is wired to every target's own.
tasks.named("detekt") {
    dependsOn(tasks.withType<io.gitlab.arturbosch.detekt.Detekt>().matching {
        it.name != "detekt" && !it.name.startsWith("detektBaseline")
    })
}
```

These lines restate the setup of Pantrix's own modules for a module's build file; as written here they were not run in an app's build. An app on detekt 1.23.8 and Kotlin 2.4 needs no pin of detekt's Kotlin: detekt holds its own (2.0.21), and the rules' `kotlin-stdlib` beside it did no harm (seen in an app).

Where detekt is built upon its own default configuration (`buildUponDefaultConfig = true`), the rule set's own configuration turns three rules on: `FixedSideLayout`, `ImageWithoutDescription`, `UntaggedControl`. The rules of the library alone start off; an app turns them on in its own configuration if it wants to. The configuration Pantrix's demo is checked with, as an app, with the last two rules reporting and not stopping the build:

```yaml
# config/detekt/detekt.yml: the configuration Pantrix's demo is checked with, as an app built on the library.
build:
  # These two report and do not stop the build: a finding of weight nought does not count towards maxIssues.
  weights:
    UntaggedControl: 0
    ImageWithoutDescription: 0

# detekt's own rules, off: only the rules an app keeps of Pantrix's run. An app that wants them leaves these out.

The rule classes are compiled for JVM 17: the JDK that runs detekt has to be 17 or newer.

## 6. Detekt and Kotlinter

| | Detekt | Kotlinter |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **What it looks at** | The code's quality and its rules | The code's form |
| **A finding, for example** | "This size belongs in the component's style" | "A space is missing here" |
| **The answer** | Fixing the code, or an exception with its reason | `./gradlew formatKotlin` |
